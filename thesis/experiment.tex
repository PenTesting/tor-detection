\chapter{Experiment}

Several systems are configured and installed using the Ubuntu operating system with VirtualBox installed. The systems are:

Lankiveil 192.168.0.16
Client system
Ginaz 192.168.0.17
Web hosting system

Ginaz
Ginaz hosts a number of web site simultions. These include a series of static web sites with different configuration combinations, representing available web tools and technologies. \cite

These sites are hosted using a self signed SSL certificate \cite, although most commercial sites would not use a self signed certificate, it should not have any bearing on the communications fingerprint \cite.

Controls
Web server:
  Apache
  Nginx
Web site:
  Static(1-20)
  Random
Method:
  SSL
  Tor
  SSL over Tor
Clients:
  Selenium firefox
  Curl


Lankiveil 
Lankiveil executes a basic ruby script which runs a number of simulations:
\begin{itemize*}
  \item RSpec tests that go through selenium scripts, simulating user interaction, by mimicking user interactions with a web site through the Firefox browser.
  \item Automated fetching of websites using the Curl program.
\end{itemize*}

Corrin 192.168.0.18
Is the control system, it monitors packets and ensures the simulation is running. tcpdump is configured on this system to monitor ports that have been configured for encrypted traffic.
