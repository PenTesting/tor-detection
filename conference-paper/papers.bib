title = {Breaking four mix-related schemes based on universal re-encryption},
abstract = {Universal Re-encryption allows El-Gamal ciphertexts to be re-encrypted without knowledge of their corresponding public keys. This has made it an enticing building block for anonymous communications protocols. In this work we analyze four schemes related to mix networks that make use of Universal Re-encryption and find serious weaknesses in all of them. The Universal Re-encryption of signatures is open to existential forgery, and the two mix schemes can be fully compromised by an passive adversary observing a single message close to the sender. The fourth scheme, the rWonGoo anonymous channel, turns out to be less secure than the original Crowds scheme, on which it is based. Our attacks make extensive use of unintended 'services' provided by the network nodes acting as decryption and re-routing oracles. Finally, our attacks against rWonGoo demonstrate that anonymous channels are not automatically composable: using two of them in a careless manner makes the system more vulnerable to attack.},

abstract = {Abstract. We describe Freenet, an adaptive peer-to-peer network ap- plication that permits the publication, replication, and retrieval of data while protecting the anonymity of both authors and readers. Freenet op- erates as a network of identical nodes that collectively pool their storage space to store data files and cooperate to route requests to the most likely physical location of data. No broadcast search or centralized loca- tion index is employed. Files are referred to in a location-independent manner, and are dynamically replicated in locations near requestors and deleted from locations where there is no interest. It is infeasible to dis- cover the true origin or destination of a file passing through the network, and difficult for a node operator to determine or be held responsible for the actual physical contents of her own node.},

title = {Sybil-resistant DHT routing},
abstract = {Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are very efficient distributed systems for routing, but at the same time vulnerable to disruptive nodes. Designers of such systems want them used in open networks, where an adversary can perform a sybil attack by introducing a large number of corrupt nodes in the network, considerably degrading its performance. We introduce a routing strategy that alleviates some of the effects of such an attack by making sure that lookups are performed using a diverse set of nodes. This ensures that at least some of the nodes queried are good, and hence the search makes forward progress. This strategy makes use of latent social information present in the introduction graph of the network.},

useful information such as the the identities of the conversing

analysis.

Mixmaster is based on D. Chaum's mix-net protocol.
A mix (remailer) is a service that forwards messages, using public key
cryptography to hide the correlation between its inputs and outputs.
Sending messages through sequences of remailers achieves anonymity and unobservability of communications against a powerful adversary.

We then propose an alternative information theoretic measure of anonymity which takes into account the probabilities of users sending and receiving the messages and show how to calculate it for a message in a standard mix-based anonymity system. We also use our metric to compare a pool mix to a traditional threshold mix, which was impossible using anonymity sets. We also show how the maximum route length restriction which exists in some fielded anonymity systems can lead to the attacker performing more powerful traffic analysis. Finally, we discuss open problems and future work on anonymity measurements.},

abstract = {In this paper we took at the information an attacker can extract using a statistical disclosure attack. We provide analytical results about the anonymity of users when they repeatedly send messages through a threshold mix following the model of Kesdogan, Agrawal and Penz [7] and through a pool mix. We then present a statistical disclosure attack that can be used to attack models of anonymous communication networks based on pool mixes. Careful approximations make the attack computationally efficient. Such models are potentially better suited to derive results that, could apply to the security of real anonymous communication networks.},

The anonymity of such mixes is measured based on their delay characteristics, and as an example the exponential mix (sg-mix) is analysed, simulated and shown to use the optimal strategy. We also describe a practical and powerful traffic analysis attack against connection based continuous-time mix networks, despite the presence of some cover traffic. Assuming a passive observer, the conditions are calculated that make tracing messages through the network possible.},

abstract = {We present a mix network topology that is based on sparse expander graphs, with each mix only communicating with a few neighbouring others. We analyse the anonymity such networks provide, and compare it with fully connected mix networks and mix cascades. We prove that such a topology is efficient since it only requires the route length of messages to be relatively small in comparison with the number of mixes to achieve maximal anonymity. Additionally mixes can resist intersection attacks while their batch size, that is directly linked to the latency of the network, remains constant. A worked example of a network is also presented to illustrate how these results can be applied to create secure mix networks in practise.},

title = {Solid state NMR characterization of individual compounds and solid solutions formed in Sc2O3-V2O5-Nb2O5-Ta2O5 system},
abstract = {In this study, V-51, Sc-45 and Nb-93 MAS NMR combined with satellite transition spectroscopy analysis were used to characterize the complex solid mixtures: VNb9(1-x)Ta9xO25, ScNb(1-x)TaxO4 and ScNb2(1-x)Ta2xVO9 (x = 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0). This led us to describe the structures of Sc and V sites. The conclusions were based on accurate values for V-51 quadrupole coupling and chemical shift tensors obtained with V-51 MAS NMR/SATRAS for VNb9O25, VTa9O25 and ScVO4. The Sc-45 NMR parameters have been obtained for SC203, ScVO4, ScNbO4 and ScTaO4. On the basis of Sc-45 NMR and data available from literature, the ranges of the Sc-45 chemical shift have been established for ScO6 and ScO8. The gradual change of the Sc-45 and V-51 NMR parameters with x confirms the formation of solid solutions in the process of synthesis of VNb9(1-x)Ta9xO25 and ScNb(1-x)TaxO4, in contrast to ScNb2(1-x)Ta2xVO9. The cation sublattice of ScNb(1-x)TaxO4 is found to be in octahedral coordination. The V sites in VNb9(1-x)Ta9xO25 are present in the form of slightly distorted tetrahedra.

title = {Breaking four mix-related schemes based on Universal Re-encryption},
abstract = {Universal Re-encryption allows El-Gamal ciphertexts to be re-encrypted without knowledge of their corresponding public keys. This has made it an enticing building block for anonymous communications protocols. In this work we analyze four schemes related to mix networks that make use of Universal Re-encryption and find serious weaknesses in all of them. Universal Re-encryption of signatures is open to existential forgery; two-mix schemes can be fully compromised by a passive adversary observing a single message close to the sender; the fourth scheme, the rWonGoo anonymous channel, turns out to be less secure than the original Crowds scheme, on which it is based. Our attacks make extensive use of unintended ''services'' provided by the network nodes acting as decryption and re-routing oracles. Finally, our attacks against rWonGoo demonstrate that anonymous channels are not automatically composable: using two of them in a careless manner makes the system more vulnerable to attack.},

The mechanism is an adaptation of Rivest's "chaffing and winnowing", which has the legal advantage of using authentication keys to provide privacy. We identify a weakness in Rivest's particular choice of his "package transform" as an "all-or-nothing" element within his scheme. We extend the basic system to allow the passing of several messages concurrently. Only some of these messages need be divulged under legal duress, the other messages will be plausibly deniable. We show how this system may have some resilience to the type of legal attack inherent in the UK's Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act.},

As these design options have implications on the achievable anonymity and performance, this paper aims to elaborate the advantages and disadvantages of either concept. After clarifying the scope of the discussion, we present arguments for Mix cascades and P2P designs on multiple areas of interest: the level of anonymity, the incentives to cooperate, aspects of availability, and performance issues. Pointed thesis and antithesis are given for both sides, before a final synthesis tries to articulate the status quo of the discussion.},

title = {Inhomogeneity of phase transformations beta->omega and beta->alpha in the quenched cold-rolled alloy Zr-20%Nb},
abstract = {The inhomogeneous character of phase transformations in the quenched cold-rolled alloy Zr-20%Nb was investigated using new X-ray diffractometric procedures based on a position sensitive detector. It was shown that the distribution of strain hardening in beta-grains with different orientations controls the development of phase transformation beta --> alpha and beta --> omega in the rolled alloy. Derivative phases inherit the substructure inhomogenity of the beta-phase, i.e. their grains are most dispersive and/or have the most distorted crystalline lattice in texture minima, where both phase transformations develop primarily. To explain the obtained X-ray texture data a mechanism was suggested involving local formation of quasi-amorphous boundary interlayers by cold rolling and their crystallization by annealing.},

abstract = {We study the effect compulsion attacks, through which an adversary can request a decryption or key from an honest node, have on the security of mix based anonymous communication systems. Some specific countermeasures axe proposed that increase the cost of compulsion attacks, detect that tracing is taking place and ultimately allow for some anonymity to be preserved even when all nodes are under compulsion. Going beyond the case when a single message is traced, we also analyze the effect of multiple messages being traced and devise some techniques that could retain some anonymity. Our analysis highlights that we can reason about plausible deniability in terms of the information theoretic anonymity metrics.},
