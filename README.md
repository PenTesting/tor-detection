# Tor Detection

or

## Using traffic analysis to identify The Second Generation Onion Router

This project is a simple honours thesis and conference paper submission that
demonstrates that using some basic traffic analysis techniques, Tor traffic can
be easily identified. The experiment results have been removed to save space.
